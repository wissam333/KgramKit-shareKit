## ✨ What is KKit?

KKit is a **fully self-hosted, serverless toolbox** built with Nuxt 3. It replaces a stack of paid SaaS tools with a single open-source app that you deploy once and use forever — for free.

All real-time features (screen share, video calls, whiteboard, clipboard sync) run **peer-to-peer via WebRTC**. Your server never touches the data stream. Your hosting bill doesn't change whether you use it zero times or ten thousand times.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/wissam333/kkit.git
cd kkit

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### For local cross-device testing (Mirror features)

Screen share and video calls require HTTPS. To test on your phone from your laptop:

npm run dev -- --https --host
```

Your phone can then access it via `https://YOUR_LAN_IP:3000`.

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## 📱 Mirror — How It Works

```
Host opens Mirror page → gets a unique session ID
         ↓
Host clicks a mode (Screen Share / Video / Whiteboard etc.)
         ↓
A QR code + share link appears
         ↓
Viewer scans QR on their phone
         ↓
PeerJS broker exchanges a tiny handshake (< 1KB)
         ↓
WebRTC direct P2P connection established
         ↓
All data flows directly browser → browser
Your server sees nothing after this point
```

## 🔐 GramKit — Security Model

GramKit uses the **official Telegram API** (MTProto) through GramJS running entirely in your browser.

- Your API ID, API Hash, and phone number **never leave your device**
- Your session string is stored only in `localStorage` in your own browser
- No backend proxy — your browser connects directly to Telegram's servers
- You can revoke the session anytime from Telegram Settings → Active Sessions

To use GramKit you need a free Telegram API key from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).

## 🌍 Internationalization

KKit ships with full **Arabic (RTL)** and **English (LTR)** support. The UI automatically mirrors for RTL languages including layout, icons, and text direction.
